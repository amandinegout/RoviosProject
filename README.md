# RoviosProject
Machine Learning/Computer Vision/Robotics project

This project was completed with my co-worker Yann-RaphaÃ«l LIFCHITZ.

This repository only contains the ROS nodes students had to work on during the project.

The report allows understanding how the nodes work and what was the purpose of this project. 

Please note that the report is written in French.

Goals :

1- Open-loop control

2- Rovios's Detection - Axis PTZ Camera

3- Clustering of Rovios

4 - Kalman filter : localisation of Rovios and closed-loop control
